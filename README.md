# React Todo List

This is a simple to-do list application made with react, and useReducer per instructions. Although the application is simple enough to have everything in App.jsx I took the liberty of turing the List itself into a component to help with readability and to go with a more React mindset.

# Instructions

To create a To-Do item all you need to do is type inside of the input box and click the add button. You can edit already created To-Dos, and also delete To-Dos as long as the todo is checked as per instructions.

# Note

Although the actual To-Do functionality was simple to implement this was the first time using useReducer.
